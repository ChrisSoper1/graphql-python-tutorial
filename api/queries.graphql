# Exercise 1!
# Let's play with queries in GraphiQL!
# - run `invoke start` to run queries against `localhost:8000/graphql`
# - copy this file into the query editor window
# try:
# - adding fields (use autocomplete!)
# - removing fields
# - changing value for `display` argument  on `authorName` field (use autocomplete!)
query stories {
  stories {
    id
    title
    authorName(display: LAST_FIRST)
  }
}

# If you want to explore further, try queries against a public API, like GitHub.
# GitHub's V4 GraphQL API is a great example of a Relay-compliant GraphQL API, with rich domain.
#
# Just login using your github credentials to explore!
# https://developer.github.com/v4/explorer/

# Here is a sample query for github to get you started:

# query myGithubComments {
#   viewer {
#     login
#     bio
#     issueComments(last: 10) {
#       edges {
#         node {
#           createdAt
#           id
#           body
#           url
#         }
#       }
#     }
#   }
# }
