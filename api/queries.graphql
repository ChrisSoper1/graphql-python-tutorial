# Exercise 3!
# Test the fields that you just added to the schema!
# - run `invoke start` to run queries against `localhost:8000/graphql`
# - copy this file into the query editor window
# - copy the below text into Query Variables
# {"storyId": "U3RvcnlUeXBlOjI="}
# try:
# - query for one story data using the node field and $storyId variable
# - run the `allStoryIds` to find another value for the  $storyId variable
# - change the variable value and run `dataForOneStory` query again
query dataForOneStory($storyId: ID!) {
  story: node(id: $storyId) {
    id
    ... on StoryType {
      title
      authorName
    }
  }
}

# Use this query to get a new story ID
query allStoryIds {
  stories {
    id
  }
}
